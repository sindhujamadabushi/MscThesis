This repository contains an implementation of my Master's thesis project "Graph Sketches and Embeddings: A Study of their Applications in Graph Databases." The project aims to study the effects of graph sparsification and graph embedding methods on important properties of graphs, such as betweenness centrality, page rank, community detection, and connected components.

The repository contains the project code, which has been updated and refined recently. Detailed results and evaluations of the project can be found in my Master's thesis, located in the "pdf" folder within this repository. The graph data used for this project is located in the "data" folder and was generated using LDBC DATAGEN (https://ldbcouncil.org/post/datagen-data-generation-for-the-social-network-benchmark/).
