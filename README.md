This repository showcases my recent re-implementation of my masters thesis project "Graph Sketches and Embeddings: A Study of their Applications in Graph Databases". The project aims to study the effects of graph sparsification and graph embedding methods on important properties of graphs like betweenness centrality, page rank, community detection, and connected components.

The repository contains the project code, which has been updated and refined recently. Detailed results and evaluations of the project can be found in the Masters thesis PDF, located in the "pdf" folder within the repository. The graph data used for this project is located in the "data" folder and was generated using LDBC DATAGEN (https://ldbcouncil.org/post/datagen-data-generation-for-the-social-network-benchmark/).
